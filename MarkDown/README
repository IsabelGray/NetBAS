Examples: using 50 permutations from yeast PIN.

1. yeast.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script calculate the frequencies between each pair of BP terms from the yeast PIN (the original BioGrid PIN)
The heatmap was plotted agains log10(freq+1) (the frequencies vary from 0 to > 7000).

2. yeast.ms02.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script do the same calculations as for 1, for permutations. 50 permutations are used here.
All results are saved in the directory "/ms02.yeast/bp-bp/"

3. yeast.bp.z.heatmap.Rmd
This script calculate the Z-scores for each BP term, resulting in a n*n matrix, where n is the total number of BP terms.
Heatmap is plotted based on this matrix, positive Z-scores are in red, and negative Z-scores are in blue, respectively.
