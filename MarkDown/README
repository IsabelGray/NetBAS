Examples: using 50 permutations from yeast PIN.

1. yeast.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script calculate the frequencies between each pair of BP terms from the yeast PIN (the original BioGrid PIN)
The heatmap was plotted agains log10(freq+1) (the frequencies vary from 0 to > 7000).

2. yeast.ms02.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script do the same calculations as for 1, for permutations. 50 permutations are used here.
All results are saved in the directory "/ms02.yeast/bp-bp/"

3. yeast.bp.z.heatmap.Rmd
This script calculate the Z-scores for each BP term, resulting in a n*n matrix, where n is the total number of BP terms.
Heatmap is plotted based on this matrix, positive Z-scores are in red, and negative Z-scores are in blue, respectively.

4. yeast.cm15.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script calculate the BP terms from proteins that interact with the CM15 set (225 genes).
The result is a spectrum-like, 1D array.

5. yeast.cm15.ms02.bp.matrix.Rmd
This script do the same calculations as for 4, for permutations. 50 permutations are used here.
All results are saved in the directory "/ms02.yeast/cm15/"

6. yeast.cm15.bp.z.heatmap.Rmd
This script calculate z-scores of BP terms from CM15 set.
The enriched (Z > 3) and suppressed (Z < -3) BP terms are recorded in the files yeast.cm15.bp.enriched.csv and yeast.cm15.bp.suppressed.csv, respectively.
The top 10 enriched BP terms are plotted as heatmap.

7.human.pd1.annotation.Rmd
This script using human PIN for GO annotations of the protein PD-1 (id: PDCD1). This gene is one of the genes that function with the T-cells to block the immune reaction and is the target for immuno-therapy in cancer (Nobel Prize in Medicine 2018)
Because only 100 permutations have been used, the sampling resulted to an Inf value term, which shall be discarded here.
Note that no suppressed GO terms have been found using the NetBAS method for the annotation of PD-1 gene.
Significantly enriched GO annotations for PDCD1 include
"T cell receptor signaling pathway" (GO:0050852, z=40.757), "T cell differenciation" (GO:0030217, z=18.73), "T cell costimulation (GO:0031295, z=18.216), "T cell activation" (GO:0042110, z=9.496), in line with the role of this gene for regulating the T-cell functions (for which GO:0031295 is already in the known GO terms of the PD-1 gene).

8.08.rnf43.bp.z.Rmd/08.refine.rnf43.bp.Rmd
These scripts using the pancreatic tumor cell BF factors (Nature Med. 2017) and biologicla process GO terms 
to calculate the GO enrichment of quantile 20 (top 5% in Bayesian factors) genes

9.09.rnf43.heatmap.Rmd
Using the refined script in 8 (08.refine.rnf43.bp.Rmd), generate the heat map of all genes in the pancreatic cell line.
